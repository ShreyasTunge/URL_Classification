# URL_Classification
The URL Classification project utilizes machine learning to categorize URLs into four classes: benign, defacement, phishing, and malware. It aims to enhance cybersecurity by automatically identifying potentially malicious URLs.

# Dataset
The dataset used for training the model consists of labeled URLs from various sources. The data has been extracted from the url's (Feature extraction) with multiple features. The dataset includes examples of benign URLs as well as URLs associated with defacement, phishing, and malware.

# Model Training 
The machine learning model is trained using various classification models like Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, DT, RF, AdaBoost.

# Usage
Once the model is trained, it can be deployed as part of a cybersecurity system or integrated into existing applications. The model can be used to analyze URLs in real-time, providing instant feedback on their classification. This can be valuable in web browsers, security applications, or network gateways where proactive threat detection is crucial.

# Results and Evaluation
The model's performance can be evaluated using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The best performing ones are Logistic regression and SVM.
